	abstract = {The parametric path method applies projection methods to compute the equilibrium time path of economic variables in in nite-horizon dynamic models. We exploit the special structure of equilibrium paths common in such models to construct a low-dimensional set of candidate solutions, and then use e cient integration and equation solution methods to  nd an approximate solution. Simple illustrative examples show that the parametric path method can  nd excellent approximations with little computational cost. ? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
